# Research Projects

Main Contributor ListDB Key-Value Store https://github.com/DICL/listdb
(will be publicly available after the OSDI'22 presentation) ListDB is an
LSM tree-based key-value store optimized for persistent memory. As the
first author, I contributed most of the design and implementation of
ListDB. ListDB's paper was published at OSDI '22.

Student Researcher National Project for High-Performance Distributed
Deep Learning This project is a nation-wide project that many research
labs in Korea participate in. This project covers various fields ranging
from machine learning applications to system-level research for
distributed model training. I worked on an asynchronous decentralized
approach using RDMA to solve the network communication overhead of
distributed training in Tensorflow.

Contributor Velox Bigdata Framework https://github.com/DICL/VeloxMR
Velox is a decentralized big data processing framework implemented in
C++, consisting of distributed file systems, in-memory caches, MapReduce
and SQL engine. I worked on implementing MapReduce engine.
