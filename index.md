# Research Projects

Contributor Velox Bigdata Framework https://github.com/DICL/VeloxMR
Velox is a decentralized big data processing framework implemented in
C++. Velox consists of distributed file systems, in-memory caches,
MapReduce and SQL engine. I contributed to implementing MapReduce
engine.

Student Researcher National Project for High-Performance Distributed
Deep Learning This project is a nation-wide project that many research
labs in Korea participate in. This project covers various fields ranging
from machine learning applications to system-level research for
distributed model training. I am investigating performance issues of
parameter servers in distributed tensorflow.
